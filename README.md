# ChamNex Electrical Installation Services

This repository contains a small React (Vite) website scaffold for ChamNex Electrical Installation Services — a colourful, responsive marketing site you can host on Vercel.

Local development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Deploy to Vercel:

1. Push this repository to GitHub (or another Git provider).
2. In Vercel, click "Import Project" and connect the repository.
3. Vercel should detect the framework (Vite). If not, set the Build Command to `npm run build` and the Output Directory to `dist`.
4. Deploy — the site will be live on a Vercel subdomain.

Notes & next steps I can help with:

- Add your logo and photo assets (I can place them under `src/assets`).
- Connect a proper contact form (Formspree or a serverless endpoint).
- Configure environment variables or analytics for the production site.

If you want, I can also deploy this site to your Vercel account directly — tell me whether you have granted Vercel access to this repository or prefer to do the final import yourself.
